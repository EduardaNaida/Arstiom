The head contains the title of the application window, and the various
imports that are needed.

First we link to the style sheet that we will use for the project.
This is still fairly small, as compared to what may be needed for a
larger project. In such cases it might be useful to divide the css file
into a number of smaller css files.

One such division could be to have one file for the overall theme of
the whole system, and then separate css files for the pecularities of
different modules and pages. It is important to remember that css
definitions override each other. This means that we can define partial
styles, which are refined or overridden in later loaded style sheets.

Next we import all the javascript files that are needed for the project.
Among the javascript files is also the jQuery library that will be used.

Also note that the order of loading is important, in that javascript is
a script (yes!) language, and the functions will be defined and
run in the order of loading.

The body is the place where all the action taks place. Well, action might
be a bit too strong word. The body defines the containers that will contain
the information, in order to present it to the user.

As you can see, the containers in most cases have an element name
(e.g., span or div), an optional class name (e.g., b-wid) and an
identification tag (e.g., fun1 or arg2).

Items belonging to the control-view have a javascript call to the
corresponding function that will perform the action. The input fields
have the contenteditable property set to "true", which means that we
can use them as form fields.

The sum-tag is a fixed div, producing a label. The display tag denotes
div where the results are displayed after the action has been performed.

Note here that there are no strings in the HTML code here. All the
information is created and inserted by javascript functions when the
page has been loaded (see the bottom part of the file "Control.js").
The HTML structure thus turns into a framework that needs to be populated.
